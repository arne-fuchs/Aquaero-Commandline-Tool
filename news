Since 1.0beta2

  - easy association from FANs/LEDs to Sensors 
    (e.g. fan.1.sensor.1  and  fan.1.sensor.2)
  - easier FAN-config
    (see fan.1.mode  and  fan.1.mode_raw)
  - additional sub-command: "short"
    displays "relevant" information only
    (vgl.  ./aeinfo short)
  - Temps are being output as comma-values
  - named values (e.g. if timer.1.off.switchtime == 255, then "always on" will
    be displayed)
  - hex-dump-output (e.g. for expansion.rw, aquabus.buffer)

Since 1.0beta3

  - colored output
  - little in-code documentation

Since 1.0

  - made 'aquaero_rev4.cpp' and 'comm.h' work stand-alone
  - a small example
  - more colorful and improved output
  - 'fan.X.setPower' now appears as percentage-values
  - changed 'string ValueParser<T>::unparse(T)' to 'void ValueParser<T>::unparse(ostream&,T)'
  - more or less compileable under win32 with msvc98 - but not working with libusb-win32 :-(
